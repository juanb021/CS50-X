# CS50


## CS50X:
CS50X is a comprehensive online course that provides a solid foundation in computer programming and web development. Throughout the course, I learned a wide range of topics, including C, arrays, algorithms, memory management, data structures, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.

The course started with an introduction to C programming, covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. I learned how to write efficient algorithms and manipulate arrays, and gained a deep understanding of memory management and data structures.

As the course progressed, I delved into web development, learning key technologies such as Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained hands-on experience in building dynamic web applications, designing responsive web pages, and implementing interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

One of the highlights of the course was learning Flask, a powerful web framework for Python. I gained proficiency in building web applications using Flask, and learned how to implement routing, handle forms, and interact with databases using SQL.
